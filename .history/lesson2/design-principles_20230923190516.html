<p>Hicks law essentialy states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and 
  complexity of choices. The above screen shot of the google home page does a great job at showing how to 
  simplify a search page. You can see by how little content there actually is on that search engine page. 
  This is to make it easier for users to complete their one and only task for using that web page, which 
  is to search for something without a getting distracted.  </p>
