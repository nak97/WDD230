<h1> Hicks Law</h1>

<p>Hicks law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and 
  complexity of choices. The above screen shot of the google home page does a great job at showing how to 
  simplify a search page. You can see by how little content there actually is on that search engine page. 
  This is to make it easier for users to complete their one and only task for using that web page, which 
  is to search for something without a getting distracted.  </p>

<h1> White Space and Clean Design</h1>

<p>The white space and clean design principle simply has to do with how you use your white space within 
  a webpage to make it easy to view the content that you place on your web page. The universities homepage 
  does an exellent job of using white space in a way that makes the website feel clean and not so cluttered.
  you can see from the screenshot that there is a fair amount of white space but it is used to help space out 
  the content.
