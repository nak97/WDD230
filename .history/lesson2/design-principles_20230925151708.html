<p>Hicks law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and 
  complexity of choices. The above screen shot of the google home page does a great job at showing how to 
  simplify a search page. You can see by how little content there to distract the user from what the page is actually for. 
  This is to make it easier for users to complete their one and only task for using that web page, which 
  is to search for something without a getting distracted.  </p>

<p>The white space and clean design principle simply has to do with how you use your white space within 
  a webpage to make it easy to view the content that you place on your web page. The universities homepage 
  does an excellent job of using white space in a way that makes the website feel clean and not so cluttered.
  you can see from the screenshot that there is a fair amount of white space but it is used to help space out 
  the content.

<p>proximity is a design principle used to convey ideas by grouping similar items or thoughts close to each other.
  This helps to convey different thoughts should your content have multiple different ideas. In the example above
  Sam's Club conveys proximity through grouping coupons together so as to get the attention of the viewer that
  there are various coupons available in the different catagories and that the viewer should take a look at what 
  there is.
